Tekton is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating 
CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across 
cloud providers and on-premise systems.

In this scenario, you will build a basic CI/CD workflow with Tekton that
fetches code from GitHub, runs all the tests, builds the code into an
app, and deploys to a Kubernetes cluster.

**Note**: You can use the resize button on the top-right corner of this
scenario to switch to full-screen mode.
