Tekton is Kubernetes-native and works well with widely-adopted CI/CD solutions,
such as [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)/[Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/),
[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/), and [Knative](https://knative.dev/).
It is flexible, and supports many advanced CI/CD patterns, including
rolling, blue/green, and canary deployment.

In this scenario, you will learn about Tekton TaskRuns and PipelineRuns,
the custom resources in Tekton for running a specific task or pipeline.
More specifically, **you will create a TaskRun and PipelineRun that
trigger a task and a pipeline respectively, which downloads an app
from GitHub and runs some tests.**

**Note**: You can use the resize button on the top-right corner of this
